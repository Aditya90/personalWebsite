                  <h2>RPi Robot</h2>
                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     I've been pondering getting started with the Raspberry Pi for quite a while now for robotic projects I've had. I plan to buy a robotics hardware platform with motors, wheels and a base as I do not have the tools to make one myself. I might eventually upgrade the hardware, but I'd like to focus on getting the software up and running first.

                     It's always nice to have an aim in writing, so this is what it's going to be. To build a robot which can perform the following:-
                     <ol type="1">
                        <li> Move around the house on its own </li>
                        <li> Create a map of the house in a 2D terrain as it navigates (SLAM) </li>
                        <li> Recognize voice inputs and respond to them </li>
                     </ol>

                     I have also hosted this project on <a href="https://www.hackster.io/adi1690/rpi-robot-for-the-home-work-in-progress-004bf8">Hackster IO</a>.

                  </p>
                  <h3>Work done</h3>
                  <p>
                     I obtained the robot base kit finally last week, and spent some time assembling it together. It came with 2 acrylic bases and 5 motors along with the fasteners required.

                     <table>
                        <tr>
                           <td>
                              <img src="../images/projects/rpiRobot/img_kit.jpg" alt="garden" width="500px" />
                           </td>
                        </tr>
                     </table>

                     It took some time to put it together, but nothing was too complicated. The tedious part was, surprisingly, the peeling of the sticker which covered the acrylic. Here is a before and after picture :

                     <table>
                        <tr>
                           <td>
                              <img src="../images/projects/rpiRobot/img_bases.jpg" alt="garden" width="500px" />
                           </td>
                        </tr>
                     </table>

                     The fully assembled kit looks like it is below. There are a lot of screws which need to be placed, sit helped a lot having an electric screwdriver. I am yet to join both the pieces of acrylic together or solder the wires through as I need to get some more materials. Here is the present state of the robot :

                     <table>
                        <tr>
                           <td>
                              <img src="../images/projects/rpiRobot/img_motorsAssembled.jpg" alt="garden" width="500px" />
                           </td>
                        </tr>
                     </table>

                  </p>

                  <p>
                     I am now working on getting the hardware assembled to plug the moisture sensor in and perform calibration.
                  </p>

            </tr>
