						<p>
							I'm a second year Master's student in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia,PA). I work at the GRASP lab as a Research Assitant focussing on SWARM robotics and humanoid robots. I obtained my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Amrita School of Engineering (Coimbatore, India). I stayed in Dubai(U.A.E.) for a significant part of my life, before going back to my home town of Trichur (Kerala, India) where I completed my schooling. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I find learning a satisfying experience, and am always in the process of broadening my skill set. My main areas of interest are :-
							<ul>
							<li>Process Automation and Control Systems</li>
							<li>Unmanned Vehicles</li>
							<li>Biomedical Robotics</li>
							<li>Swarm Robotics</li>
							<li>Electrical Systems</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I've also developed a recent interest in machine learning and its application to electrical systems. 
						</p>
						
            <p>
              I was the captain of the Amrita soccer team and now play soccer occasionally at UPenn. I've always been inclined to photography and recently bought a Canon Rebel XT on which I've started experimenting my photography skills.
