# Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi

## Motivation
I've been pondering getting started with the Raspberry Pi for quite a while now for
robotic projects I've had.

I plan to buy a robotics hardware platform with motors, wheels and a base as I do not
have the tools to make one myself. I might eventually upgrade the hardware, but I'd
like to focus on getting the software up and running first.

It's always nice to have an aim in writing, so this is what it's going to be.

To build a robot which can perform the following:-
1. Move around the house on its own
2. Create a map of the house in a 2D terrain as it navigates (SLAM)
3. Recognize voice inputs and respond to them

## Getting started

What I have right now is the following :-
1. A Raspberry Pi B+
2. A 4 wheel robot platform I got off of Ebay
