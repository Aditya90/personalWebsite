## Description

The aim of this project was to develop robotic modules which are capable of forming random goal structures autonomously. The goal structure will be specified by the user, but all other aspects such as docking algorithm, motion planning, selection of modules, etc. must be done autonomously.

## Personal Objectives

I was working on the software end of this project. My focus was on Matlab simulations and control system implementation.
- Developed a Matlab based simulation environment for :-
    1. Testing the SWARM algorithm for goal structure formation
    2. Testing control system behavior with water dynamics
- Implemented station keeping on a single robotic module using PID control (C++ code)
